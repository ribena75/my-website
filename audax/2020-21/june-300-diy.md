### Short

Broke my 300km duck. ðŸ¦†ðŸ’¥

### Long

300km DIY by GPX from SE London to Sandwich, down the Kent coast and over Romney Marsh to Rye, then back to LDN.

Only had 4 hours sleep and the stress of a snapped seatpost collar the night before wasn't the greatest of preparations, but set off I did at 04:45 AM.

Main roads and Medway industrial most of the way to Canterbury, not the most inspiring of routes but the light headwind was kind and the roads were fast. Some nice sections from Canterbury to Sandwich where I had planned to stop for lunch, but cafes were either too busy or not interested in serving me. I pushed on a bit to Deal where I found a decent (and friendly!) seafront cafe with benches, so had some beans on toast and bread and butter pudding in the rain.

I headed down the coast with a tailwind but ended up being quite slow going over the cliffs at Dover and Folkstone, with a mixture of long drags and busy coastal paths. Hythe and Romney Marsh was quicker, lucky with the wind again, especially across the marsh. Really hot by then, stopped to put on suncream (too late). I should have rested at Rye but nothing appealed so carried on until I found a shop at Appledore where I chilled for a bit with a sandwich, Coke and jelly babies. 

From there the shifting cross wind and tiredness, combined with saddle pain (I had moved saddle back to accomodate Carradice Bagman - new inline Condor seatpost will hopefully negate this) meant the next 60-70km or so was pretty tough, but hacked on in small increments. I also needed to poop but couldn't quite face having a dump in a field. Anyway... uncomfortable lol. Finally made it to my mental target: Riverhead at 285km. I knew the roads from there, but had an unexpected mental slump as I knew it meant a fair way still. But I was close, so just took it easy until I made it home.

I didn't feel as wrecked as I thought I would - legs fine, but hands and arse took a beating. Still need to play with bike setup. New Carradice was fab, a lot lighter than previous Barley. Think will probably stick with the Ortlieb 4.1l for 100-200km warm weather rides, with the Carradice for 200km+ and/or winter rides.
